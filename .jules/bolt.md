## 2025-04-04 - Remove unnecessary `isMounted` hydration checks to enable SSR
**Learning:** Components like `ShopProductCard` often cargo-cult the `isMounted` hydration-safe pattern from components that actually need it (like a `CartSheet` that reads persisted local storage). If a component only *modifies* state (e.g., uses `addItem` from a Zustand store) or relies on stable server-provided props, the `isMounted` check forces it to render a skeleton on the server.
**Action:** Remove `isMounted` hydration checks from components that do not render dynamic client-side state. This immediately enables full Server-Side Rendering (SSR) for those components, dramatically improving SEO, First Contentful Paint (FCP), and Largest Contentful Paint (LCP).

## 2024-05-24 - Prevent N+1 queries in Firestore lookups
**Learning:** Using `Promise.all(items.map(... => adminDb.collection("...").doc(id).get()))` creates an N+1 query problem, causing multiple network roundtrips to Firestore. This significantly degrades backend performance, especially when checking out carts with multiple items.
**Action:** Always batch Firestore document lookups by ID into a single network call using `adminDb.getAll(...documentRefs)` instead of looping. Note that `getAll()` expects arguments to be spread and requires at least one document reference, so always add an empty array check (`if (items.length === 0) return/throw`).

## 2024-05-24 - [Plan Review Groundedness Rule]
**Learning:** When using `cat` for large files, terminal output is easily truncated in the trace history. This leads to Groundedness Rule violations when proposing to remove variables or imports that are assumed to be unused.
**Action:** Before proposing to remove any variables, imports, or code in an execution plan, explicitly verify they are genuinely unused in the entire file using targeted tools (like `grep -rn "variableName" file.tsx` or `read_file`) instead of relying solely on the potentially truncated output of `cat`.
## 2026-05-14 - Deduplicate App Router Database Calls
**Learning:** In Next.js App Router, extracting shared non-fetch database calls (like Firebase Admin queries) from `generateMetadata` and the main page component and wrapping them in `React.cache()` eliminates duplicate N+1 style server-side requests across a single render lifecycle.
**Action:** Always wrap direct database/SDK calls with `React.cache()` when they are utilized in both metadata generation and page rendering to optimize TTFB and reduce database load.
