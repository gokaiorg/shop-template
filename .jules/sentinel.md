## 2024-05-24 - Authorization Bypass in Next.js Server Actions
**Vulnerability:** Critical authorization bypass in `/admin` functionalities. Server Actions defined in `src/actions/admin.ts` (`createCategory`, `createProduct`, `seedDemoData`) lacked explicit authentication/authorization checks. Although the `/admin` routes are protected by `middleware.ts`, Server Actions can be invoked directly from anywhere, allowing unauthenticated users to modify the database.
**Learning:** In Next.js App Router, `middleware.ts` protection on routes does not automatically secure Server Actions used by those routes. Server Actions are independent endpoints.
**Prevention:** Every Server Action performing sensitive operations must include direct session validation (e.g., `const session = await auth(); if (session?.user?.role !== "ADMIN") return { error: "Unauthorized" };`) regardless of the route middleware.

## 2024-05-25 - Pass-the-Hash Vulnerability in Plaintext Migration Fallback
**Vulnerability:** A "Pass-the-Hash" vulnerability existed in the credentials authorization logic (`src/auth.ts`) used to migrate plaintext passwords to bcrypt. The fallback allowed login if `user.password === credentials.password`, meaning if an attacker obtained the bcrypt hash from the database, they could supply the hash string itself as their password.
**Learning:** Fallback mechanisms intended for migration can be exploited if they don't explicitly exclude modernized/secure data formats (like bcrypt hashes).
**Prevention:** Always scope down migration fallbacks. Ensure that a plaintext fallback condition explicitly checks that the stored value is not already a hashed value (e.g., `!user.password.startsWith('$2a$') && !user.password.startsWith('$2b$')`).

## 2026-04-15 - Missing Server-Side Validation for Quantity in Checkout
**Vulnerability:** A missing validation vulnerability in checkout server actions allowed processing negative or non-integer order quantities. This could lead to negative total amounts, logic bugs, integer overflow/underflow, and inventory manipulation.
**Learning:** Even if the client-side UI prevents negative numbers, Server Actions accept raw JSON. Any numerical input affecting transaction calculations or database updates must be strictly validated server-side.
**Prevention:** Always validate, type-cast (e.g., `Number(val)`), and enforce logical constraints (e.g., `Number.isInteger(qty) && qty > 0`) on client-provided numerical input in Server Actions before performing calculations.
